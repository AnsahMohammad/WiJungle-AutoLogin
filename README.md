# WiJungle-SVNIT AutoLogin

This script automates the login process for the WiJungle Firewall of SVNIT Network. Instead of manually visiting the login page and entering your credentials each time, you can use this script to log in automatically.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Optionally, move the `login.sh` script to your home directory for easy access. You can do this with the command `mv login.sh ~`.
3. Run the script with the command `./login.sh`.
4. The first time you run the script, it will prompt you to enter your admission number and password. These will be saved for future logins.
5. The script will automatically log you in each time you run it.

### Note for Windows Users

If you are using Windows, you will need to use either the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Git Bash to run this script.
