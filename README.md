# AutoLogin for WiJungle-SVNIT

Streamline your SVNIT WiJungle firewall login experience with this automated script. SVNIT utilizes the WiJungle Firewall to manage its local network. To authenticate and access the network, students traditionally visit the URL: https://172.16.1.1:8090/ and input their admission number and password.

However, this routine login process can become mundane, leading to a dislikable task for many students. In response to this, a script has been developed that can be easily configured with your details. Once set up, the script takes care of the login process automatically, eliminating the need for manual login every time you connect to the SVNIT network. 

Say goodbye to repetitive logins and enjoy seamless access to the SVNIT network with WiJungle-AutoLogin.
